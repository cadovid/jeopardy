    "## Winning Jeopardy\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win. The dataset was recopilated by crawling the [archive of Jeopardy](http://www.j-archive.com/) and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the file is a JSON which structure is an unordered list of questions where each question has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `category` : the question category, e.g. \"HISTORY\".\n",
    "- `value` : value of the question as string, e.g. \"\\$200\" . _Note_: This is \"None\" for Final Jeopardy! and Tiebreaker questions.\n",
    "- `question` : text of question. _Note_: This sometimes contains hyperlinks and other things messy text such as when there's a picture or video question.\n",
    "- `answer` : text of answer.\n",
    "- `round` : one of \"Jeopardy!\",\"Double Jeopardy!\",\"Final Jeopardy!\" or \"Tiebreaker\". _Note_: Tiebreaker questions do happen but they're very rare (like once every 20 years).\n",
    "- `show_number` : string of show number, e.g '4680'.\n",
    "- `air_date` : the show air date in format YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a subset of the dataset, in which we sample a total of 20000 rows in which each row represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Show Number` -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- `Air Date` -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- `Round` -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- `Category` -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- `Value` -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- `Question` -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- `Answer` -- the text of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
